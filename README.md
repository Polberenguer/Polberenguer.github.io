1. Project Goals

	1.1 Target User Profile:
		So the final user I think would be someone who has a company and I'm interested to work with, and he should be interested on finding an easy way to find
		every information he/she wants to know about me, like my contact info, my language knowledge, my Work experience, the education I had and finally some extra information about me.
		
	1.2 Information architecture:
		This project, as it should be, it is only a one page project with only my Curriculum Vitae on the page, with one redirection link to my YouTube channel, but there is no more page changings or anything.
	
	1.3 Visual Design:
		For the visual design, I searched on the web some CV examples to inspire the project, as I didn't was so decided for the color i'd use, 
		I searched some information about which one are the most professional colors for a CV, and I saw lot of people talking about how professional the blue color was, 
		and that's why I decided to make the website be in some tonalities of blue, then I choosed which tonalities by choosing which I prefer the most, the text is also on some dark blue tone to make it more good looking. 
		
		The typography I choosed is the Cambria, from sans-serif family, because I think this is a very good looking typography and it matches the professionality a CV should have.
		
		Finally, talking about the page layout, I choosed a typical layout for CV, which is, on middle top, you have my name followed by the ocupation I'm searching for, 
		also on the top, this time on right place, there is a picture of the CV person, i choosed to place it on round shape, not the typical square one, this section background is made of a stronger blue colour. 
		Then, on the left side of the page, under the tittle section, you'll find the contact section on the left top, then left middle you have the Languages section and by the end, the extra information. 
		Then on the very middle of the page, you find two diferent paragraphs one with the Work experience, and other one with the education i recieved.
